# kbc-clone-in-C
This project is a clone of KBC game using C language 

Here we have used file handling to store questions and make a game dynamic we also used random function to get exactly one question at a time on current window. 
Then we have a answers in opt.c file. We built a logic to get a correct answer of particular question from this file if answer matches with user input you will get next question.
Once you answer 10 questions correctly you will the winner.

Note: you have to make capslock on while playing.
